# 3 Revenue Stream Model

All revenue will be funneled into CoHive Payroll Coffers. From there, `x%`, `y%` and `z%` will be distributed based on three separate criteria. 

### x: Finders fee / making a sale 33% (tbd)
  -  This will go directly to the individual who has generated the contract and deducted from revenue before entering CoHive Payroll Coffers.
### y: Project contributor y% (tbd)
  -  This refers to the >64% hour availability/contribution threshold per individual. If you meet this threshold you will be eligible to `company-payout / contributors` percentage.
### z: Unpaid project/Infrastructure contributor z% (tbd)
  -  This share is equivalent to this formula `z% === y% * 0.5`
  -  _Ex_: You work on an unpaid project that goes on the CoHive Site Portfolio. When Payroll is divied up you are elligible for a `(company-payout / contributors) / 2`
