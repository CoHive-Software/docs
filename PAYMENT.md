# Revenue Structure

### The following procedure will guide utilization of project revenue. Upon receipt of payment, deductions and allocations will be made in the following order and amounts:

1. Deduction, if applicable, of all funds necessary for the payment of project-specific federal, state, or local taxes.
2. Deduction of all project-specific non-tax expenses. While emphasis will be placed on accurately predicting and quoting project expenses, deductions for this purpose 
   will be made in full regardless of quoted amount.
3. Deduction, if deemed necessary by the board, of an ammount not to exceed 5% of project gross revenue and to be used for the payment of non-project-specific company 
   expenses, or for the maintenance of cash reserves deemed necessary to maintain operational funding in the face of future company expenses. If this allocation is to be 
   made, all project participants are to be notified before project commencement.

### After all applicable deductions are made, the post-deduction amount will be referred to as the "net project revenue", and allocations to project participants will occur. Allocation of net project revenue will be made in the following order:

4. Allocation of 20% of net project revenue to be made to the person or persons responsible for securing sale of the project.
5. Allocation of 10% of net project revenue, in equal proportion, to all elligible participants of company projects completed in the 60 days prior to project delivery. 
     Elligibility will follow the "Payment Threshold" guidelines outlined below in the "Payment Threshold" section.
6. Allocation of all remaining net project revenue, in equal proportion, to all project participants who have met the requirements outlined below in the "Payment Threshold" section.

Questions regarding the above procedure are encouraged to be directed to Brendan Carmichael via Discord dm.
