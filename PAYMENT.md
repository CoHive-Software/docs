# 3 Revenue Stream Model

All revenue will be funneled into CoHive Payroll Coffers. From there, `x%`, `y%` and `z%` will be distributed based on three separate criteria. 

### x: Finders fee / making a sale 33% (tbd)
  -  This will go directly to the individual who has generated the contract and deducted from revenue before entering CoHive Payroll Coffers.
### y: Project contributor y% (tbd)
  -  This refers to the >64% hour availability/contribution threshold per individual. If you meet this threshold you will be eligible to `company-payout / contributors` percentage.
### z: Unpaid project/Infrastructure contributor z% (tbd)
  -  This share is equivalent to this formula `z% === y% * 0.5`
  -  _Ex_: You work on an unpaid project that goes on the CoHive Site Portfolio. When Payroll is divied up you are elligible for a `(company-payout / contributors) / 2` 

## Payment Threshold

---

- Trellow Workspace KanBan Boards will be evaluated **INTERNALLY** and **EXTERNALLY** (by team members, team-pm and board members) and **TEAM-MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PEER REVIEW OF CONTRIBUTION**
  - **AT <= 75% OF WEEKLY CONTRIBUTION ESTIMATE PLEASE DISCUSS RE-EVALUATION WITH CONSIDERED TEAM MEMBER**
  - **AT <= 65% OF WEEKLY CONTRIBUTION ESTIMATE PLEASE ADJUST TICKET DISTRIBUTION AS THIS MEMBER WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR PAYMENT AT THIS DELIVERY PERCENTAGE**
- ALL MEMBERS WHO UPHOLD THEIR CONTRIBUTION ESTIMATES (**ASSIGNED USER-STORIES/TICKETS AND PRs TO UPSTREAM MAIN**) UPON CONTRACT FULFILLMENT, WILL BE PAID EQUAL PERCENTAGE PAYOUTS
  - If team member's contribution needs to be re-evaluated PLEASE approach with respect and consider [CONTRIBUTION_REEVALUATION](./CONTRIBUTION_REEVALUATION)
  - Team members must **ADJUST** each others **USER-STORY/TICKET ASSIGNMENT** for **CONTRIBUTION EVALUATION AFTER ADJUSTMENT IS DISCUSSED**.
    - Talk with your Project Manager (PM) to re-allocate hours that were built into estimated workload

## tl;dr
Payouts will be company wide with 3 different options for Members to be elligible for a share. Finders Fee will be deducted from Contract sale prior to entering company coffers. Two remaining shares will be divided by # of contributors.
