# How to be assigned to projects:

1. [Discord Projects Forum](https://discord.gg/6SQVNFuT)
   - This will be where new projects appear. Please react and comment on these tickets to indicate your interest
2. [CoHive Contributor Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SJh6vwCMvt3bLdduPu461B226AfwCglzGdHAbSPjDeM/edit?usp=sharing)
   - This will be where you designate your areas of interest and availability: **Sales, Design, Develop, Document** 
   - For internal Team Management refer to this [Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IGHDlYuAeU_J4DGDyoRcAZOaE3TUo5O1A5Ij-fKgdiQ/edit#gid=0)
3. [Trello Dev Queue](https://trello.com/invite/b/uEa6SxkM/ATTI13c0f88b714a7ab7c8335648628c23afCC7AF9E6/cohive-company-pipeline) (BOARD ONLY)
   - This queue will pull the most recently created team members to the bottom in order to give everyone an opportunity to work
   - _BOARD_: Replace "BENCH" label with "DEPLOYED" label as team members are assigned roles and move them to bottom of lane
4. **Once development teams have been drafted you will be contacted to verify your interest, assigned role and estimated availability**
   - At this time you may **"approve"** and join the team or **"pass"** in which case the member next in the queue will be offered the position.
5. **From this point on** look to the project's specific channel in the lower portion of the discord server where you and your team will be given Team Discord Roles
   - This will become the main lane for communication post team initialization.

### NOTE:
_Once you have been assigned a team, one of the team members will be assigned "Project Manager" role and delegate tasks in the [Trello Workspace](https://trello.com/w/cohivesoftware)_
### NOTE:
